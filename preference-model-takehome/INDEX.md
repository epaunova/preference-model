## What This Is

An RL training task where language models learn to:
1. Understand a research paper concept (variance-stabilized dropout)
2. Debug a subtle mathematical error in the implementation
3. Validate the fix with statistical tests

**The bug:** Using `1/(1-p)` scaling instead of `1/√(1-p)`  
**The challenge:** Models must derive the correct formula  
**The validation:** Empirical variance tests (must preserve variance within 10%)

## Key Features

- **Scientific concept** - Neural network training stability
- **10-40% difficulty** - Subtle bug, requires math understanding
- **Clear grading** - Automated statistical tests
- **Educational value** - Teaches paper → code implementation
- **Production ready** - Fully documented, tested, calibrated

---

## Quick Stats

- **Code:** ~300 lines (including tests, grader, docs)
- **Dependencies:** numpy only
- **Difficulty:** Calibrated for 10-40% pass rate
- **Task type:** Debugging + mathematical reasoning
